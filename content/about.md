Hello! Iâ€™m Deepak Sharda, an electronics engineer who spends most of his time working with FPGAs â€” both professionally and as a hobby. In my free time, I love exploring all domains of electronics (wellâ€¦ maybe not RF, that stuffâ€™s still a bit tough ðŸ˜…).

I enjoy everything about hardware â€” from designing architectures for ASICs to writing firmware for microcontrollers â€” and Iâ€™m always trying to get hands-on with as many aspects of it as I can.

Right now, Iâ€™m affiliated with [Vicharak](https://vicharak.in/) Computers as an FPGA Engineer, where I work on accelerating algorithms on FPGAs. Some of the notable projects Iâ€™ve worked on include:

* Gati ML Accelerator â€“ a general-purpose FPGA-based machine learning accelerator

* [Shrike](https://github.com/vicharak-in/shrike-lite) â€“ a small, open-source FPGA development board

Outside of work, I spend time tinkering with different kinds of hardware and occasionally writing blogs to share my experiments and learnings. I do post on twitter as well.
